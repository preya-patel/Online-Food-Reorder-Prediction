# Online Food Reorder Prediction

###Overview
There has been a high demand for online food orders after the introduction of Swiggy and Zomato in the market. Food delivery companies use your buying habits to make the delivery process faster. The food order prediction system is one of the useful techniques these companies can use to make the entire delivery process fast.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts if the customer will reorder or not. The model will utilize user-specific information and activity-related features to provide predictions.
